### Motivation
<p>
Our project was motivated by the strong need for affordable solutions for those with visual impairment. In the US alone, 20 million people are affected by visual impairments that make reading and processing text difficult. Of the 20 million affected in the US, 27% live below the poverty level. While text-reading tools exist on the market, many come with high price tags.
